The foundation says Costco failed to carry out its duty to ensure product safety, adding that it did not provide sufficient compensation to consumers earlier this year. In total, the foundation is asking Costco to pay NT$11.07 million to affected consumers.<br><br>Earlier this year, the hepatitis A virus was found in batches of Costco’s frozen mixed berries and blueberries. The Consumers’ Foundation has filed a class-action suit against Costco, demanding NT$20,000 in compensation for each affected consumer. It’s also seeking punitive damages of three times the purchase price, up from two.<br><br>Chen Ya-ping<br>Consumers’ Foundation<br>It’s such a large company, but its inspection mechanisms are lacking. The compensation it offered consumers was just a refund plus an amount equivalent to the purchase price. But it did not offer any compensation for matters like psychological damages.<br><br>The suit was filed on behalf of 135 consumers. It asks Costco to pay approximately NT$11.07 million.<br><br>Chen Chih-yi<br>Consumers’ Foundation<br>Back in March, Costco should have known that the contaminant was present in the products imported from the U.S. But it didn’t do anything about it. The company failed to do its job. It failed to implement self-management to ensure food safety in accordance with Article 7 of the Act Governing Food Safety and Sanitation.<br><br>Earlier this year, the consumer lobby group won a lawsuit against Top Pot Bakery, which was found to be using artificial ingredients in “all-natural” bakery products in 2013. It had sought compensation of NT$1,000 per customer affected. This time, the foundation is asking for 20 times more from Costco.<br><br>Chen Chih-yi<br>Consumers’ Foundation<br>We are seeking more compensation for psychological damages than in the previous case against Top Pot Bakery. The reason is that this time we’re dealing with toxic substances. In addition, Costco’s annual membership fees are quite high.<br><br>Costco says it will reach out to the Consumers’ Foundation for clarity on case details. It says it will continue to communicate with the foundation to ensure consumer safety.<br><br>For more Taiwan news, tune in:<br>Sun to Fri at 9:30 pm on Channel 152<br>Tue to Sat at 1 am on Channel 53</p></div> <div class="bg-my-white-250 p-4 col-span-3"><h2 class="s:text-xl text-base font-semibold overflow-hidden news_title mb-4">美式賣場賣毒莓賠償挨批消極 消基會提團訟

            DPP’s Lai dismisses KMT-TPP election alliance as ‘hollow’</h2> <h3 class="s:text-lg text-sm overflow-hidden s:news_info hidden">DPP presidential candidate Lai Ching-te has reacted to Monday’s meeting between the chairs of the KMT and Taiwan People’s Party. The two opposition parties agreed on several issues, notably that they will join forces in the legislative elections. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Lai dismissed the election alliance as, quote, hollow. He said the two parties were teaming up because, quote, neither side aligns with mainstream public opinion. Lai said that the KMT and TPP’s joint activities will have no impact on his campaign decisions. <br><br>The executive board meeting of the Associations of Star Alliance Pilots met on Tuesday, with Vice President Lai Ching-te in attendance. As the elections draw near, Lai is juggling campaign events with his official duties. When asked about recent talks between the KMT and Taiwan People’s Party, Lai appeared unfazed.<br><br>Lai Ching-te<br>Vice president<br>The reason the KMT and TPP are negotiating an alliance is because neither side aligns with mainstream public opinion in Taiwan. It’s like two minor enemies banding together to fight a larger enemy. The consensus they reached yesterday can be summed up in one word: hollow. It will have no bearing on my future campaign activities.<br><br>Lai dismissed the talks between the TPP and KMT. He pointed to one of the four points the parties agreed on: to ask the president to report to the Legislative Yuan directly instead of through the premier. Lai says the law already allows parliament to request a presidential report.<br><br>Lai Ching-te<br>Vice president<br>Article 4 of the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China already states that while the Legislative Yuan is in session, it may hear a report on the state of the nation by the president. So if the Legislative Yuan were to invite the president over, of course I would accept the invitation and go to the Legislative Yuan. The reason why previous presidents have not delivered such reports at the Legislative Yuan is because cross-party negotiations have never been able to reach a consensus on it. The Legislative Yuan has never issued an invitation to a sitting president.<br><br>Lai also criticized TPP candidate Ko Wen-je, who claimed that former Minister of Agriculture Chen Chi-chung squandered money on creating an insurance program for farmers. Lai says Ko is pointing fingers at the wrong person.<br><br>Lai Ching-te<br>Vice president<br>Had Ko Wen-je not brought it up, people wouldn’t have realized how little he knows about state affairs. He’s mixing up farmers’ insurance with agricultural insurance. It just goes to show the lack of concern he has for farmers, and his lack of support for the agricultural sector. Judging from Ko’s tone, does he want to do away with agricultural insurance? Or does he want to do away with farmers’ insurance? He should clarify his position to the public.<br><br>Lai asked Ko to make his stance clear. With the election approaching, the candidates are ramping up their rhetoric, charging up the atmosphere of the presidential race.<br><br>For more Taiwan news, tune in:<br>Sun to Fri at 9:30 pm on Channel 152<br>Tue to Sat at 1 am on Channel 53</h3> <h4 class="s:text-base text-xs mt-4">2023-10-31</h4></div></a></div><div class="cursor-pointer border-b border-solid border-my-white-50 mx-4 mt-4 mb-12 transition duration-150 ease-in hover:bg-my-white-300"><a href="/news/2023A31W0AEA" class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4"><div class="w-full"><img data-src="https://cdn.ftvnews.com.tw/engnews/images/2023/5edf5659-d0e2-47ac-b44c-7155164f55ee.jpg" class="object-cover lazyLoad"></div> <div class="md:col-span-2 flex flex-col justify-around gap-4 w-full"><h2 class="s:text-xl text-base font-semibold overflow-hidden s:news_title news_nav">

            Third-quarter GDP growth drops to 2.32% in advance estimate</h2> <h3 class="s:text-lg text-sm overflow-hidden s:news_info hidden">Taiwan’s economy grew by 2.32% in the third quarter, according to an advance estimate. That’s 0.22 percentage points lower than an August forecast by the national statistics agency. An official said that contributing factors were weak consumer demand, slowing corporate investment, as well as a high base of comparison from the same period last year. GDP growth for the year 2023 is expected to fall to 1.55%. Let’s hear from the agency. <br><br>Wang Tsui-hua<br>DGBAS official<br>Real gross capital formation in the third quarter fell by 14.04%, 9.61 percentage points lower than the August forecast. That is the main reason for the growth rate falling below expectations. But has investment really dropped off? I believe that a very important factor is last year’s high base of comparison. In terms of scale, investment stands slightly higher than it did before the pandemic, so I think that momentum is still there. As for whether the economy is making a turn for the better, GDP growth was 10.47% on a quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized basis. That marks an improvement. If the fourth quarter hits the August forecast of 5.59%, the economic growth rate for the year will be 1.55%.<br> <br>Finalized figures for the July-September period will be provided later this month. The agency stressed that annual GDP growth is subject to impact from global geopolitical tensions, such as the escalating Israel-Palestine conflict. <br><br>For more Taiwan news, tune in:<br>Sun to Fri at 9:30 pm on Channel 152<br>Tue to Sat at 1 am on Channel 53<br></h3> <h4 class="s:text-base text-xs mt-4">2023-10-31</h4></div></a></div><div class="cursor-pointer border-b border-solid border-my-white-50 mx-4 mt-4 mb-12 transition duration-150 ease-in hover:bg-my-white-300"><a href="/news/2023A31W05EA" class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4"><div class="w-full"><img data-src="https://cdn.ftvnews.com.tw/engnews/images/2023/f0dcd4c3-0c84-4c51-8b40-bc1d3aa31662.jpg" class="object-cover lazyLoad"></div> <div class="md:col-span-2 flex flex-col justify-around gap-4 w-full"><h2 class="s:text-xl text-base font-semibold overflow-hidden s:news_title news_nav">

That is the main reason for the growth rate falling below expectations. But has investment really dropped off? I believe that a very important factor is last year’s high base of comparison. In terms of scale, investment stands slightly higher than it did before the pandemic, so I think that momentum is still there. As for whether the economy is making a turn for the better, GDP growth was 10.47% on a quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized basis. That marks an improvement. If the fourth quarter hits the August forecast of 5.59%, the economic growth rate for the year will be 1.55%.\u003Cbr\u003E \u003Cbr\u003EFinalized figures for the July-September period will be provided later this month.
